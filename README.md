# Geo master 

A React web client to connect to Mongo DB to fetch geographical data and display them as tabular or on a map.
Made as a side project for my master degree, aiming to provide common data on a client and visualise them before downloading them.

Requirements : Ubuntu VM - MongoDB, React, Express, Node
